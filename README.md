Exploring K-shape algorithm. K-shape is state-of-the-art approach to time series clustering, which uses a distance measure that is invariant to scaling and shifting to preserve the shapes of time series sequences while comparing them. It requires minimal parameter tuning. 

Difference between k-means and k-shape is while calculating distance, k-shape uses shaped based distance that relies on cross-correlations.
